                <h2>Our Story</h2>

                <p>When the pandemic hit, Eliana and Lucas suddenly found themselves without jobs and filled with uncertainty about the future. It was a difficult time — but instead of giving up, they decided to turn their love for sweets into hope.</p>

                <p>Baking had always been their shared passion. Late nights in the kitchen became moments of comfort, creativity, and connection. They began sharing their homemade treats with friends, and soon, people started asking to buy them.</p>

                <p>At first, they were scared. Starting a business during such an uncertain time felt risky. But step by step, they built their dream — creating <strong>elegant sweets for weddings, parties, and special occasions</strong>. Every sweet they made carried a little bit of their story: resilience, love, and the belief that something sweet can come from hard times.</p>

                <p>Today, their small dream has become a successful bakery loved by many. Eliana and Lucas are grateful for every customer who believed in them and helped turn their fear into a beautiful new beginning.</p>

                <p>Their journey proves that even when life changes unexpectedly, passion and courage can create something truly special — one sweet at a time. 🍬💛</p>
